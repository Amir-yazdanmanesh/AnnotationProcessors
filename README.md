# AnnotationProcessors

As an Android developer, you’ve probably seen plenty of annotations already: They’re those funny code elements that start with  `@`  and occasionally have parameters attached to them.

Annotations associate metadata with other code elements, allowing you to place more information into your code. One way to make use of annotations is to generate new source files based on that information via  _annotation processing_.

You can easily set text colors with the help of this library.

 ``` 
 @ByColor(color = Color.RED)
TextView tv;
 ```
